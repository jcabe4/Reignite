NAMING CONVENTIONS:

Please avoid convoluted naming coventions like "texture_red_01_ball".  Since we are not using console commands to access files, etc., stick with a naming convention that is visually easier to read (this includes capitalization and so forth) like:

Ball - Red 1
Ball - Red 2

Font - Ariel
Background - Mountains
Background - Beach
